# Water-Sort-Puzzle-Project3LabP

In this project, classes and Stacks were used to implement a solution for the Water Sort Puzzles game type.

The behavior of the methods to be implemented is documented in the javadoc of the interfaces, and is also inferred through the expected output of the Main execution, where you can play the game as well as the expected results through the execution of the JUnit tests.
